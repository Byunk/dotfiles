Generate a unit test for the given code.

## Instructions:
1. Analyze the provided code thoroughly
2. Identify essential testable functions and methods
3. Generate unit tests with appropriate test frameworks for the language
4. Keep unit tests concise - do not add test cases only for coverage
5. Do not add redundant test cases
6. Focus on meaningful test scenarios:
   - Core functionality (happy path)
   - Critical edge cases only
   - Important error conditions
   - Essential boundary conditions

## Test Coverage Goals:
- Quality over quantity - meaningful tests only
- Test critical paths and failure modes
- Include mock/stub data where necessary
- Add descriptive test names

## Framework Selection:
- **Python**: pytest, unittest, or nose2
