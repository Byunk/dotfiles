## Your task

Perform a context-aware code review. Focus on $ARGUMENTS files.

### Phase 0: Context discovery

Before judging any code, gather context about the project:

1. **Project conventions** - Check CLAUDE.md, README, or similar docs for architectural guidance
2. **Codebase structure** - Understand the directory layout and what layers exist
3. **Existing patterns** - Find where validation, error handling, and similar concerns are typically handled in this codebase

This prevents false positives like flagging "missing validation" when validation is handled at a different layer.

### Phase 1: Intent and approach

Before looking at code details, answer:
- What is this change trying to accomplish?
- Is the approach reasonable for that goal?
- Is there a simpler way to achieve the same thing?
- Does it fit the project's existing patterns?

If the overall approach is wrong, stop here and report that.

### Phase 2: Architectural fit

Evaluate:
- Are responsibilities in the right layers?
- Does it duplicate functionality that exists elsewhere?
- Are cross-cutting concerns (validation, auth, logging, errors) handled consistently with the rest of the codebase?

### Phase 3: Technical review

Only flag issues that are actual problems, not theoretical concerns:

**Critical** (must fix):
- Security flaws not handled elsewhere in the stack
- Logic errors that will cause failures or data corruption
- Breaking changes to public APIs or contracts

**Major** (should fix):
- Approach significantly more complex than necessary
- Responsibilities in the wrong layer (or gaps in the chain)
- Error handling that loses important information
- Performance issues in hot paths

**Important**: Before flagging "missing validation" or "missing error handling", trace the data flow. If validation happens at the API boundary or errors are handled by the caller, don't flag it.
