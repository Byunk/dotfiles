# Fullstack Development Plugin

Systematic workflows and specialized agents for feature development, debugging, and testing.

## Commands

Multi-phase workflows that guide development tasks from discovery to completion:

- **`/feature-dev`** - Guided feature development with codebase understanding and architecture focus
- **`/debugging`** - Systematic debugging workflow for deployment, CI/CD, runtime, and test failures
- **`/test-dev`** - Semantic test development focused on behavior and user requirements

## Agents

Specialized agents for deep analysis and design:

- **code-explorer** - Traces feature implementations and maps architecture layers
- **code-architect** - Designs feature architectures with comprehensive implementation blueprints
- **code-reviewer** - Reviews code for bugs, quality issues, and project convention adherence
- **devops-engineer** - Debugs infrastructure issues through log analysis and configuration validation
- **test-engineer** - Designs behavior-focused test strategies with appropriate testing approaches
- **ui-ux-designer** - Designs user flows with accessible, WCAG-compliant component specifications

## Usage

Commands orchestrate entire workflows using multiple agents:

```bash
/feature-dev Add user authentication with OAuth
/debugging Container fails to start with port binding error
/test-dev Test the payment processing flow
```

Agents can be launched independently for focused tasks within workflows.
