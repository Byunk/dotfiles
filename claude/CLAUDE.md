## Style Guidelines

- No emojis in code, comments, or documentation
- Keep descriptions, comments, and documentation concise and to the point
- Avoid robotic or overly formal language - write naturally and directly
- Add comments only for important design decisions that require explanation to understand the code - otherwise skip them
